    <p>
      Bienvest Engineering was founded by Şevki Çelik, who graduated from ITU in 1984 with a master’s degree 
      in mechanical engineering. After working for over 30 years at Mapa Otomotiv in roles including production manager, 
      engineering manager, and executive board member, he established Bienvest Engineering to focus on international 
      consultancy and project management.
